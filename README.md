# Beer-Reccomendation-System

This repository contains a Beer-Reccomendation-System that uses scraped data from Beer-Advocate and a matrix factorization algorithm. I compare the results of 3 different implementation, a simple implementation that uses for loops and 2 tensorflow aplications with and without GPU support. See algorithm folder for a detailed explanation of each implementation.
